A [Wayfire] decoration plugin that uses a external executable as a client responsible for the rendering.

It is a implementation of the idea of [ammen99].

The project is composed of a Wayfire plugin and a external executable communicating through a wayland
protocol defined in the proto folder.
I used gtk3 and the rendering engine of [marco], the Mate Desktop's windows manager.
The same rendering is used too in the latest versions of compiz (gtk-window-decorator).

It parses and renders metacity themes of all versions, i.e. v1, v2 and v3. 
The executable reads its configuration from a json file defining the theme name, the buttons layout
for toplevel and dialogs and the title font. It relies on the gtk3 theming for the background and title
color, but you can override them editing the theme definition.

The supported buttons are: minimize, un/maximize, close, stick and shade.
NOTE: Not all metacity themes out there support the stick and shade buttons, only those made for marco.
And further, many themes define the left, right and bottom border as 0 px. While this was not a problem for marco
and compiz, it is in Wayfire, you can not resize.
So the plugin make sure there are at least 2 px of border, if you want can edit the theme definition to enlarge them.

It seems working fine but maybe some corner case will need some fix.

Implementing (and maybe expanding) the same protocol you can write your client using whatever suits your taste,
Qt, WxWidget etc. 
Every opened window will soon be captured by the plugin and then will no more receive pointer events.
And it is no more possible popup a menu, at least, on gtk3 is not possible. But even if it were, there is no way to
change workspace, or minimize, maximize etc. It is the plugin that handles this when receives a window_action request.

Metacity themes have a menu button that would be ideal for a menu of actions on the window, but I don't know how to 
show a menu from a plugin.

And finally... I used C++ between 1998 and 2003, it changed a bit ! 
I struggled to get up to date for the task but almost certainly some things could be done better. 
The same is valid for Wayfire, I only scratched its surface.
